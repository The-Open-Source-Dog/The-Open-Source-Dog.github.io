<h1>Misconceptions about Https and what network owners can see</h1>
<p>Writen By The Open Source Dog, Aug 24 2022</p>
<p>We use the internet every day, but you wonder, <b>how does encryption work?</b> I am here to answer that question. Lets get started by talking about how it was at the start of the internet. Early web browsers communicated with the HTTP or the Hyper Text Transport Protocol. HTTP is un-encrypted, this means that <b>any one</b> can see what is sent. Unlike now when the web began it was just pages, mostly from universities, no banking, no shopping, no sensitive info. This means that HTTP was not a risk as there was no sensitive data. Then, the internet boom, after this we began to shop, bank, and more. This caused a major problem because anyone with a bit of skills could go into a cafe and get your passcodes. So we made HTTPS or the Hyper Text Transport Protocol Secure. With the HTTPS now the friendly cafe shop hacker can only see what websites you vist. Not your passwords, not your credit card, not evan the pages you vist on a site. Lets say you visit www.realbank.com/login/Open, the hacker can only see www.realbank.com, but wait OSD, could they just swap out the certificate at the start? No, we have sorting called certificate authorities, they sign the certificates so you know that it is really github.com and not fake github.com, the best part, your web browser dose this for you (:! If the lock is in the bar you are safe. But, OSD, no you could have malware, a CA could get compromised and we must trust? Yes this relies on TRUST, the good thing, the CA is not the higest up! ICAN is, they sign the CA and your broswer can un trust a ca at any time or you can tell it to. Thats it (: enjoy!</p>
